# Heapq

Support **heaps**, data objects where each node is either greater than or equal to its parent (**max-heap**) or less than or equal to its parent (**min-heap**)
Create a heap from {iterable}
```py
heapq.heapify(iterable)
```
Remove and return the smallest element of {heap}
```py
heapq.heappop(heap)
```
Replace the smallest element of {heap} with {element}
```py
heapq.heapreplace(heap,element)
```
