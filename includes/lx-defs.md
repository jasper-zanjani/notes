**/etc/shadow**
:   Colon-delimited file containing password hashes for every user listed in [/etc/passwd][/etc/passwd]
    ```
    $USERNAME:$PASSWORD:$LASTCHANGED:$MIN:$MAX:$WARN:$INACTIVE:$EXPIRE
    ```

    - **$USERNAME** Login name
    - **$PASSWORD** Encrypted password; dollar signs delimit encryption hash function ([`$1`](#etcshadow "MD5"), [`$2a`](#etcshadow "Blowfish"), [`$2y`](#etcshadow "Blowfish"), [`$5`](#etcshadow "SHA-256"), or [`$6`](#etcshaodw "SHA-512")), then salt, then hash value. After locking the account with `usermod -L`, an exclamation point `!` is placed in front of this field, making the password inoperable and locking the account.  When an account has not yet had a password set, this value is `!!`
    - **$LASTCHANGED** Days since 01/01/1970 that password was last changed
    - **$MIN** minimum number of days required between password changes
    - **$MAX** maximum number of days the password is valid before user is forced to change password
    - **$WARN** number of days the password is to expire that user is warned that password must be changed
    - **$INACTIVE** number of days after password expires that account is disabled
    - **$EXPIRE** days since 01/01/1970 that account is disabled
