### History

Kubernetes was first announced by Google in mid-2014. 
It had been developed by Google after deciding to open-source the Borg system, a cluster and container management system that formed the automation infrastructure that powered the entire Google enterprise.
Kubernetes coalesced from a fusion between developers working on Borg and [Compute Engine](/Cloud#compute-engine). Borg eventually evolved into Omega.

By that time, Amazon had established a market advantage and the developers decided to change their approach by introducing a disruptive technology to drive the relevance of the Compute platform they had built. 
They created a ubiquitous abstraction that could run better than anyone else.

At the time, Google had been trying to engage the Linux kernel team and trying to overcome their skepticism. 
Internally, the project was framed as offering "Borg as a Service", although there were concerns that Google was in danger of revealing trade secrets.

Google ultimately donated Kubernetes to the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation**.
