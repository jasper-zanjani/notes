    - [systemd-nspawn](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-nspawn.html) can be used as an alternative to podman or docker. With btrfs, these can be snapshotted and then layered on top of the host OS's filesystem.
    - **Pipewire** has become an all-purpose multimedia backend that has enabled an unprecedented level of capabilities for both audio and video production on Linux

    - Speculation on the significance of the resignation of former CEO Jim Whitehurst from Red Hat and his replacement by IBM executive Arvind Krishna
    - Although [Rocky Linux](https://rockylinux.org/) appears to have won an early lead in the race with [AlmaLinux](https://almalinux.org/) to become heir-apparent to CentOS as the free drop-in replacement for RHEL, the governance model concentrates control in the hands of its founder [Gregory Kurtzer](https://gmkurtzer.github.io/). Rocky Linux is structured as a [public benefit corporation](https://rockylinux.org/organizational-structure/) owned by Kurtzer. Chris speculates that the reason for Rocky Linux's support in the community may be the mere fact of Kurtzer's association with the project, since Kurtzer himself founded CentOS in 2002.
