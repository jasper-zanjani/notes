Enable access control to X server
```sh
xhost -
```
Disable access control to X server, allowing clients from any host to connect (not unsafe if you use a firewall that allows only SSH)
```sh
xhost +
```
Add `$HOST` to list of authorized clients for X server
```sh
xhost +$HOST
```
Remove `$HOST` from list of authorized clients for X server
```sh
xhost -$HOST
```
Add `$USER` to ACL
```sh
xhost si:localuser:$USER
```
