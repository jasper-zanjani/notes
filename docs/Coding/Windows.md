### COM

The **Component Object Model** is a binary standard interface specification for objects.
It originated in 1993 as a renaming of OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) 2.0, used by Microsoft Office at the time to link data between applications.

COM objects support a collection of interfaces, most importantly **`IUnknown`** which all COM objects must implement.
IUnknown includes `QueryInteface()` which returns pointers to the other interfaces also implemented by the COM object.
It also includes `AddRef()` and `Release()`, which manage the object's lifetime.

COM uses HRESULTs, 32-bit longs, to indicate success or failure.
Bit 31 indicates success (0) or failure (1).
With .NET [interop](#interop), a failed HRESULT turns into a thrown COMException.
Common HRESULTs include `S_OK`, `S_FALSE`, `E_FAIL`, and many other failure codes also beginning with `E_`.

COM objects are created by calling `CoCreateInstance()`.
This function, which is stored in ole32.dll, searches the Registry for the given class ID, then loads the apropriate **COM Server** DLL file.
This DLL file then creates a class factory which then creates the COM instance, which is passed back to the client as an interface pointer.

COM classes must be registered in the Registry, at minimum by mapping the class ID (a GUID) to a DLL, in the **HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT** hive.
This is done using the **regsvr32.exe** utility.
