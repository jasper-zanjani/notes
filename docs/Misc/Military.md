*[VDV]: Russian Airborne Forces (vozdushno-desantnye voyska)


# Military

## Russia

Battalions can be subordinate to brigades or regiments, depending on context.
Brigades are more self-contained, whereas regiments are themselves subordinate to divisions.

#### VDV
:   
    Modern VDV units can be [divided](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgNNCrWETcU) by mode of entry into airborne and air assault units.

    Historically, airborne troops were controlled by the Soviet General Staff for strategic objectives: capturing command and control nodes, political targets, etc deep in enemy territory.
    Air assault forces, in contrast, generally operated heavier ground equipment and had operational objectives to support ground forces.
    Some air assault forces had been under the control of military districts but since 2013 have been consolidated into the VDV.

    Both air assault and airborne platoons consist of 3 squads in their own IFVs, either the [BMD-2](#bmd-2) or the [BMD-4M](#bmd-4m).
    Each IFV can only mount 7 personnel, of which two are the driver-mechanic and gunner-operator who remain with the vehicle after infantry dismount.
    Apparently the deputy platoon commander stays in the vehicle as well, providing a total of 14 dismounts per platoon.

    Airborne and air assault companies combine three such platoons with a Headquarters Section made of two additional IFVs.
    Air assault companies add a Grenade-Machine Gun Section in its own APC.

    Three such companies in combination with reconnaissance and support platoons and a medical section, form the core of a battalion.
    Air assault battalions add a mortar battery with six tubes.
