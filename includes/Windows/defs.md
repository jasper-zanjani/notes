**executive**{: #executive }
:   The Windows executive contains base OS services like memory management, process and thread management, security, I/O, networking, and IPC

**heterogeneous multi-processing**
:   A type of SMP-based design where some processor cores have less capability but higher efficiency than others.
    This allows power consumption to be reduced by allocating appropriate work to slower cores while power managing the faster ones.

**kernel**{: #kernel}
:   The Windows kernel consists of low-level OS functions, like thread scheduling, interrupt, and exception dispatching, and multiprocessor synchronization.
    It also provides a set of routines and basic objects that the rest of the executive uses to implement higher-level constructs.

**kernel mode**{: #kernel-mode }
:   privileged processor mode with access to system data and hardware

**user mode**{: user-mode}
:   non-privileged processor mode with limited access to system data and no direct access to hardware
