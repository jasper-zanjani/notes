## Ability scores
Six **ability scores** define the capabilities of every character and monster in the game.
Each of these are obtained by rolling 4d6, then discarding the die with the lowest value.

- Strength
- Dexterity
- Constitution
- Intelligence
- Wisdom
- Charisma

Alternatively, 27 points can be spent according to the following table to arbitrarily determine ability scores.

| Ability score | Cost |
| ------------- | ---- |
| 8             | 0    |
| 9             | 1    |
| 10            | 2    |
| 11            | 3    |
| 12            | 4    |
| 13            | 5    |
| 14            | 7    |
| 15            | 9    |

Finally, the following set of scores can be used if either of the two methods above are unacceptable: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8.

## Ability modifiers

**Ability modifiers** apply to each score according to its value. These modifiers are equivalent to finding the floor of half of the score's difference with ten (i.e. (13-10) // 2 = 1, but (7-10) // 2 = -2)

| Ability score | Modifier | Ability Score | Modifier | Ability Score | Modifier |
| ------------: | -------: | ------------: | -------: | ------------: | -------: |
|             1 |       -5 |         12-13 |       +1 |         22-23 |       +6 |
|           2-3 |       -4 |         14-15 |       +2 |         24-25 |       +7 |
|           4-5 |       -3 |         16-17 |       +3 |         26-27 |       +8 |
|           6-7 |       -2 |         18-19 |       +4 |         28-29 |       +9 |
|           8-9 |       -1 |         20-21 |       +5 |            30 |      +10 |
|         10-11 |        0 |

## Class

A class describes a character's vocation, talents, and combat style.

- **Class features** are capabilities unique to each class
- **Proficiencies** in armor, weapons, saving throws, and other items define a character's talents
