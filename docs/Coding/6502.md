### Registers

\# | Register | Size | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
**PC** | Program Counter | 16 bit | pointer to the next instruction
**SP** | Stack pointer | 8 bit | holds low 8 bits of the next free location on the stack
**A** | Accumulator | 8 bit | used for all arithmetic operations (except for incrementation and decrementation)
**X** | X register | 8 bit | available for holding counter or offset values for memory access. It also has the special function of copying or changing the value of SP.
**Y** | Y register | 8 bits | available for holding counter or offset values for memory access.

## Opcodes
All opcodes are 1 byte in size, and their operands are 0, 1, or 2 bytes
