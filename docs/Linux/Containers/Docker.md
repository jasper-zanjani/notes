# Docker

Docker **repositories** are associated with a single image, various versions of which can be specified with a **tag**.

On Windows, **Docker Desktop** is Docker's runtime which has been integrated with WSL 2 since June 2019. 
Previous to that, Docker distributed its own Linux kernel to use on Windows hosts.

On Linux, Docker must be run as root, although a user can be added to the **docker** group to manage Docker as a [non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) for convenience.
This is called [**rootless mode**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/), where both the daemon and containers run in a user namespace.


#### Networking

On Linux, the Docker daemon creates a virtual Ethernet bridge named **docker0**, which is assigned an unused private IP range and address.
Every container is associated with a pair of virtual Ethernet interfaces, of which one is visible to the container and the other is tied to this bridge.

- The container's interface is named following a pattern similar to `eth0@if17`, where the number after **if** is the index of the host's interface.
The IP address visible to the container belongs to the bridge's subnet.
- The host's interface is named similar to `vethe8b40b8@if16`, where again the number after **if** indicates the index of the container's interface.

Container networks can use various drivers, which are associated with specific key-value pairs in `daemon.json`:

- **NAT**: containers reside in their own network and the host acts as gateway and set with `{ "fixed-cidr" : "10.0.0.0/24" }`.
- **Transparent**: containers are assigned IP addresses on the same physical network to which the host belongs (similar to **External** virtual switches in Hyper-V), set with `{ "bridge": "none" }`.

Create a new network bridge using the **transparent driver**
```sh
docker network create -d transparent $NETWORKNAME
```
Create a transparent network bridge with static IP addresses
```sh
docker network create -d transparent --subnet=10.0.0.0/24 --gateway=10.0.0.1 $NETWORK
```

#### Storage

Docker has several options for persistent storage:

- [**Volumes**](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) are stored in a part of the host filesystem which is managed by Docker (/var/lib/docker/volumes/ on Docker).
- [**Bind mounts**](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) map a file or directory on the host machine to a mount point in the container. They have less functionality than volumes.
- **tmpfs mounts** are stored in-memory only, and are available only on Linux.

Volumes can be mounted using **--volume** or **--mount**.

- **--volume** syntax combines all options together in one field.
- **--mount** is more explicit and verbose, with key-value pairs defined for the following keys:
    - `type`
    - `source`
    - `destination` (also `dst`, `target`)
    - `readonly`
    - `volume-opt`

Connect to a session on a running container
```sh
docker attach $CONTID
```

Build a Docker image from a [Dockerfile](#dockerfile) in the present working directory
```sh
docker build -t web .
```

Save changes made to a modified container to a new image
```sh
docker commit $CONTID $USER/$CONT
```

[Simple][udemy] Docker compose file
```yaml
version: '2.0'

services:
  web:
    image: sample-01
    build: .
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
```

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Bring everything down
```sh
docker-compose down -v
```

Create docker image named "hello" with tag "v0.1" from contents of current directory
```sh
docker image build -t hello:v0.1 .
```

Display a list of all running containers
```sh
docker ps -a
```

Remove a container completely (must be stopped, unless `-f` is used)
```sh
docker rm $CONTID
```

Create a Hyper-V container
```sh
docker run -it --isolation=hyperv microsoft/windowsservercore powershell
```

Bind port 80 of the container to port 8080 of the host
```sh
docker run -it -p 8080:80 microsoft/windowsservercore powershell
```

Create a container with a static IP address on the network you created
```sh
docker run -it --network=$NETWORK --ip=10.0.0.16 --dns=10.0.0.10 microsoft/windowsservercore powershell
```

To detach from a running container use the keyboard shortcuts ++Ctrl+P+Ctrl+Q++

Start a stopped container
```sh
docker start $CONTID
```

Stop a container
```sh
docker stop $CONTID
```

**docker tag** can be used to rename images and to prepare them to be pushed to a repository using **docker push**

Tag an image on local container host
```sh
docker tag $USERNAME/$IMAGENAME:$TAG
```

Display data volumes
```sh
docker volume ls
```
