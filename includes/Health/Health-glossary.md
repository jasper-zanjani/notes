#### Acetylcholine

**Acetylcholine** (ACh) is an important neurotransmitter. 
It is broken down by the cholinergic enzyme Acetylcholinesterase (AChE). 

#### Alpha-GPC

**L-alpha-glycerolphosphorylcholine (Alpha GPC)** is the highest quality and most bioavailable form of [**choline**](#choline). 
Unlike Alpha GPC, other forms of choline were found not to be able to cross the **blood-brain barrier**, preventing enhancement of cognitive performance. 
It is not yet officially defined as one of the B vitamins, even though it is associated with them.

An injectable prescription-only form of alpha-GPC exists called Delecit that is not available in the US.

#### Alpha lipoic acid

**Alpha-lipoic acid** (ALA or LA, also [thioctic acid](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/alpha-lipoic-acid)) is a powerful antioxidant that can replenish both vitamins C and E. 
Vitamin E requires vitamin C or [coenzyme Q](#coq10) to regenerate after being used up in the [free radical reaction](#glossary).

- [A 2011 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002934310007436) found that obese subjects given doses of 1,000-1,800 mg for up to 20 weeks experienced a loss of around 3% of body weight.
- A 2015 [literature review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002934310007436) found that ALA is only marginally effective in combating obesity in conjunction with good diet and exercise.

<details><summary>ALA exists in two <a href="#glossary">enantiomeric</a> forms: R and S.

#### Ashwagandha

_**Withania somnifera**_ or **Ashwagandha** is a traditional [Ayurvedic herb](#ayurveda) used as a memory aid. 

- It has been shown to increase serum testosterone in infertile men. ([2009](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19501822/))
- In a double-blind, placebo-controlled [crossover study](#crossover-trial), healthy men administered Ashwagandha (500 mg/day) experienced improved cognitive performance outcomes. ([2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24497737))
- A study that compared the difference in effect of 250 and 600 mg/day found that the higher dosage was associated with significantly greater stress and anxiety reduction and increased sleep quality. ([2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6979308/))

**Ayurveda**{: #ayurveda }

A traditional system of herbal medicine originating in India (ref [Bacopa](#bacopa))

#### Bacopa

Bacopa monnieri is an [Ayurvedic](#-glossary) herbal medicine. 
Studies have substantiated its use in enhancing memory by [reducing](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27473605/ "The Ayurvedic plant Bacopa monnieri inhibits inflammatory pathways in the brain") inflammation in the brain.

The main nootropic constituents of Bacopa are believed to be dammarane types of triterpenoid saponins known as **bacosides**. 
Most clinical studies focus on memory, to the omission of other facets of cognition like fluid intelligence, typically lasting 12 weeks. 
The long-term effect of Bacopa is unknown, but animal models suggest protection from age-related neurodegeneration. ([2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23772955/ "Neuropharmacological review of the nootropic herb Bacopa monnieri") :material-file-pdf:)

There are several putative mechanisms of action:

- Anti-oxidant/neuroprotection
- Acetylcholinesterase inhbition
- Choline acetyltransferase activation
- Beta-amyloid reduction
- Increased cerebral blood flow
- Monoamine potentiation and modulation


A mix of [Bacopa monnieri](#bacopa), [Lycopene](#lycopene), [Astaxanthin](#astaxanthin), and [vitamin B12](#vitamin-b12)) administered orally once a day to subjects aged 60 years old or more resulted in improved cognitive performance after 8 weeks. ([2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33375429/))

A neuropharmacological review found that the maximum efficacious dosage was 200 mg/kg. ([2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3746283/))

#### Choline

**Choline** is a precursor to the neurotransmitter [**acetylcholine**](#acetylcholine). It is endogenously produced and found in food. Many supplements contain choline because it is cheaply produced, but studies indicate it may not be able to cross the blood-brain barrier.

Another product of choline is **betaine**. For individuals who have genetic polymorphisms like MTHFR and are thus far less able to produce B12 and folate, the pathway producing betaine compensates for this shortcoming, which results in deprivation of acetylcholine for cognition.


**Cholinergic**{: #cholinergic }

Relating to or denoting nerve cells in which acetylcholine acts as a neurotransmitter

**Crossover trial**{: #crossover-trial }

A trial where subjects are randomly assigned to study arms where each arm consists of two consecutive bouts of treatment separated by a washout period.
A concern with crossover trials is that there is a chance that subsequent rounds of treatment may be influenced by earlier ones.


#### Citrullus lanatus

- A late 2020 [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33376745/) found that mice given [_Cucumis melo_](#cucumis-melo) and **watermelon** ([_Citrullus lanatus_](#citrullus-lanatus)) seed extract experienced enhancement of memory and cognition.



#### Citrus Bergamot

Improves [lipid profile](#-glossary).



#### CoQ10

Ubiquinone, also called Coenzyme Q, is a coenzyme family ubiquitous to animals and bacteria. 
**Coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub> (CoQ10)** is the most commonly found form in humans, an endogeneously produced lipid-soluble antioxidant that metabolizes into [ubiquinol](#ubiquinol). 
It is one of the most popular supplements and renowned for being a powerful antioxidant. 
Doses are usually 100-200 mg/day, although there is no established upper limit for tolerance.

- A meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials found that CoQ10 supplementation increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) and decreased malondialdehyce (MDA) and diene. ([2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30758695/))
- A meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials found that CoQ10 supplementation significantly increased total antioxidant capacity (TAC), SOD, CAT, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), as well as significantly decreased MDA. ([2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32328242/))
- A 2021 study found that horses who were fed CoQ10 experienced [persistent improvement](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33349408/) in semen quality.
- Patients receiving from 300-1200 mg/day exhibited no difference in incidence of drug-related toxicities between placebo and treatment arms. ([2002](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12374491/))



#### Creatine

**Creatine monohydrate**

A [2018 review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0531556518300263) of six studies found that creatine can improve short-term memory and intelligence/reasoning in healthy individuals.

#### Cucumis melo

[**Muskmelon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muskmelon) is a species of melon that includes honeydew and cantaloupe.

A late 2020 study found that mice given _Cucumis melo_ and _Citrullus lanatus_ seed extract [experienced enhancement](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33376745/) of memory and cognition.

#### Curcumin

**Curcumin** ([diferuloylmethane](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/curcumin)) is the principal biologically active [polyphenolic][polyphenol] constituent of turmeric (_Curcuma longa_). It is a powerful antioxidant binding to COX-2 and 5-LOX and has been found to increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).

- Curcumin supplementation increases serum **brain-derived neurotrophic fator (BDNF)** ([2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0271531719301009)).
- A literature review found that ([2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32972010/ "Can Brain Health Be Supported by Vitamin D-Based Supplements? A Critical Review") :material-file-pdf:): 
    - Curcumin can act as a neuroprotectant antioxidant by binding to COX-2 and 5-LOX.  
    - Curcumin inhibits the activation of microglial cells and protects dopaminergic neurons against microglia-mediated neurotoxicity. 
    - Curcumin inhibits the caspase-3 apoptosis mediator, suggesting that it is an anti-apoptotic agent that would be useful in treating neurodegenerative diseases.
- A meta-analysis found that curcumin can improve therapy for people with symptoms of depression and anxiety ([2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31423805/)).
- Curcumin has very poor bioavailability without co-administration of piperine. ([1998](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9619120/))
- A systematic review and meta-analysis found that curcumin administration was associated with a significant reduction only in systeolic blood pressure, but not in diastolic, in studies with supplementation exceeding 12 weeks. ([2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31647981/))

#### D-Aspartic acid

**D-Aspartic acid** or D-Aspartate is an amino acid found in various tissues, including in the axon terminals and synaptic vesicles of neuronal tissue and endocrine glands. It is known to induce testosterone synthesis in the testis.

- A literature review concluded that exogenous D-Asp increases testosterone in animals. However, human studies which demonstrated conflicting results were noted for their short-term generation, small sample size, and other problems. ([2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5340133/ "The putative effects of D-Aspartic acid on blood testosterone levels: A systematic review") :material-file-pdf:)
- Most studies used dosages of 2,600-3,000 mg/day ([Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/d-aspartic-acid-and-testosterone))

| Product                                                                                                                                      |    $ |   mg |     $/3g |

#### DMAE

**Dimethylaminoethanol** (marketed as DMAE but appearing more commonly as deanol in scientific literature) is not a precursor to [acetylcholine](#alpha-gpc) as is commonly asserted. However it is hypothesized that it may increase acetylcholine levels by inhibiting choline metabolism.

- In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, children given 40 mg of [Ritalin](#ritalin) or 500 mg of deanol experienced similar improvements in psychometric tests. Deanol appeared to be more effective for those with learning disabilities. ([1975](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1092513/))

#### L-Arginine

**L-Arginine** is an amino acid widely used in pre-workout supplements because it enhances blood flow.
It works by providing nitrogren to the **nitric oxide synthase (NOS)** enzyme to produce nitric oxide (NO), being metabolized to **L-citrulline** in the process. 
L-citrulline, in turn, can be reconverted to L-arginine in the kidneys. 
Both L-citrulline and L-arginine regulate nitrogen and ammonia in the blood.

Bioavailability of l-arginine can vary up to 70%, but excessive dosages can cause gastrointestinal issues. L-citrulline, in contrast, has a bioavailability of practically 100%, which is why it is favored now.



#### L-Carnitine

[Several forms](https://www.ergomaxsupplements.com/blog/what-form-of-carnitine-is-right-for-you/) of **L-carnitine** are available:

- **L-carnitine L-tartrate** (LCLT) is a salt of L-carnitine that increases androgen receptor uptake. 
    - Resistance-trained men given LCLT experienced an increase in AR content ([2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16826026/))
    - It is absorbed faster than other L-carnitine esters ([2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15830915/))
- **Acetyl L-carnitine** (ALCAR) is an ester of L-carnitine that can pass through the blood-brain barrier, and its acetyl group ensures that it is active in the central nervous system. It is a "substrate" for [acetylcholine](#acetylcholine).
- **L-carnitine fumarate** is marketed as a weight loss booster under the name Carnishield

#### L-Tyrosine

**L-Tyrosine** is the most bioavailable form of Tyrosine, especially in comparison with N-acetyl-L-Tyrosine, and a precursor to the neurotransmitter **dopamine**, thyroxine, adrenaline and noradrenaline, and the catecholamines. It is converted by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase.

L-Tyrosine is commonly believed to [reduce](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0361923089900968) and [relieve stress](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1863555/) and [enhance](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30094335/) cognitive performance.

- Tyrosine abolished fear expression, apparently because of its effect on the catecholaminergic system. ([2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31690824/))
- A literature review of 15 studies found that tyrosine acutely counteracts decrements in working memory and information processing caused by cognitive load or bad weather. ([2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25797188/))

#### Phosphatidylcholine

**Phosphatidylcholine** is a **phospholipid** that incorporates choline as a headgroup.

- Humans with cognitive disorders who were fed two forms of phosphatidylcholine (~100 mg) after breakfast experienced an improvement in their [MMSE][MMSE] scores so significant that their new scores rose above the diagnostic threshold for cognitive disorder. ([2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3038136/?tool=pmcentrez))
- Administration of phosphatidylcholine to mice with impaired memory due to inbreeding raised their brain acetylcholine concentration to the level of unimpaired mice and resolved their poor memory function. However, phosphatidylcholine treatment did not affect memory or acetylcholine concentrations in normal mice. ([1995](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7782901/))
- During a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, prenatal supplementation of phosphatidylcholine resulted in improvement of cognitive performance of fetus (P50 inhibition). Delay in development as measured by this test is associated with schizophrenia and developmental problems. ([2013](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2012.12070940))
    - This finding confirmed earlier research on the long-term benefit of prenatal choline supplementation in animals.

#### Phosphatidylserine

**Phosphatidylserine** (PtdSer or PS) is a **phospholipid** that supports a gamut of cognitive functions. It is found in the inner leaflet of neural cell membranes where it regulates the release of neurotransmitters acetylcholine, dopamine, and noradrenaline. Two sources of phosphatidylserine were available: bovine-cortex (BC-PtdSer) which has fallen out of favor due to the risk of transferring infections from prion-infected brains, and soy (S-PtdSer).

- In a randomized, double-blind trial, children diagnosed with ADHD but never having received drug treatment related to it experienced significantly improved ADHD symptoms and short-term memory after 2 months of phosphatidylserine supplementation (200mg/day).
- Exogenous dosages of 300-800 mg/d are absorbed efficiently, cross the blood-brain barrier, and reverses biochemical deterioration in nerve cells as a result of aging. ([2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25933483/))

Red wine contains less than 13 mg of resveratrol per liter. ([src](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/6-anti-inflammatory-supplements#TOC_TITLE_HDR_6))
It is confirmed as a powerful antioxidant and may potentially enhance cognitive performance. 

- A systematic review found that supplementation with resveratrol does not have an anti-obesity effect. ([2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33487308/ "What is the effect of resveratrol on obesity? A systematic review and meta-analysis")) :material-file-pdf:
    - In contrast, an earlier systematic review cited in this one **did** find that resveratrol supplementation had a positive effect on weight loss. ([2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30421960/ "The effects of resveratrol intake on weight loss: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials"))
- A comprehensive review found that even moderate daily supplementation (0.5-1 g) is enough to inhibit estrogen metabolism and increase SHBG. ([2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32744480/ "The estrogenic activity of resveratrol: a comprehensive review of in vitro and in vivo evidence and the potential for endocrine disruption"))
- Resveratrol has poor bio-availability and a short half-life (1.5 hours). ([2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30816367/ "Health benefits of resveratrol administration") :material-file-pdf:).
- Resveratrol upregulates SHBG expression in the liver. ([2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28947831/))
- A literature review found that resveratrol intervention lowered total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and fasting glucose with more significant reductions when doses were higher than 300mg/day. ([2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27456934/))
- A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled [crossover study][crossover trial] found that administration of resveratrol (150 mg/day) caused no changes in metabolic risk markers in overweight and obese subjects after 4 weeks with a 4-week washout period. ([2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25790328/))

#### Rhodiola

**Rhodiola rosea** is an adaptogenic herb used in traditional medicine in Europe and Asia.

- A [2018 meta study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30564123/ "Rhodiola rosea L. Improves Learning and Memory Function: Preclinical Evidence and Possible Mechanisms") :material-file-pdf: examined 36 animal studies and concluded that rhodiola can improve learning and memory function, despite an earlier [2012 review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22643043/ "Rhodiola rosea for physical and mental fatigue: a systematic review") that found that methodological problems with earlier experiments brought these findings into question.
- A [clinical trial in 2000](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11081987/) found that young physicians experienced improvement in cognitive performance on a battery of cognitive tests called the Fatigue Test. The study concluded that rhodiola could reduce general fatigue under stressful conditions.
- A [similar 2003 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12725561/) found that young military cadets were able to resist fatigue better with rhodiola.

#### Rosemary

Mark Moss with Northumbria University has published several studies on the cognitive benefits of various herbs, including peppermint, chamomile, rosemary, and lavender.
The studies on rosemary in particular were motivated by [traditional associations](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/news-events/news/2016/04/herbs-that-can-boost-your-mood-and-memory/) of rosemary with memory.

- Aromatherapy with rosemary oil resulted in improvement in cognitive performance ([2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2314808X16301890)).
- Drinking rosemary water produced a small benefit to memory ([2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30318972/))
- Cognitive benefit of rosemary aromatherapy was associated with concentration of 1,8-cineole. ([2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23983963/))
- An interesting study contrasted the impact of aromatherapies of lavender and rosemary oils. Rosemary enhanced performance for overall quality of memory, but also impaired speed of memory compared to control. Lavender actually impaired performance of working memory. Rosemary boosted alertness in comparison to both control and lavender. Both lavender and rosemary enhanced contentment. ([2003](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12690999/))

#### Taurine

Dosages of taurine in studies are commonly 500 - 2,000 mg /day, however higher doses appear to be well-tolerated.

#### Tryptophan

**Tryptophan** is a precursor of the neurotransmitters serotonin and melatonin.


#### Ubiquinol

**Ubiquinol** (QH) is the fully reduced form of [ubiquinone](#coq10). Intense exercise depletes CoQ10, but supplementation with ubiquinol prevents this deprivation. 

Ubuiquinol is more bioavailable than CoQ10 by an order of magnitude. ([2013](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-10-24))

Like [vitamin E](#vitamin-e), ubiquinol is a lipid-soluble antioxidant, which gives it the special task of protecting sensitive cell membranes. Ubiquinol is depleted before vitamin E because it reacts with radicals first, and it can also replenish depleted vitamins E and C. ([2013](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-10-24))

- Healthy and well-trained fireman given 200mg/day ubiquinol for two weeks experienced increases in the biomarkers of bone formation and energy mobilization, suggesting ergogenic effects. ([2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32797125/))
- CoQ10 was positively associated with antioxidant capacity, muscle mass, muscle strength, and muscle endurance in patients with osteoarthritis. ([2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33327636/))
- Subjects with mild cognitive impairment who received 200 mg/day ubiquinol for a year experienced improved cerebral [vasoreactivity](#-glossary) compared to baseline and placebo, but no significant neurological improvement. ([2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33498250/))
- In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, ubiquinol supplementation increased physical perforrmance. ([2013](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1550-2783-10-24 "Ubiquinol supplementation enhances peak power production in trained athletes: a double-blind, placebo controlled study") :material-file-pdf:)
- Ubiquinol supplementation to mice reduced a variety of markers associated with fatigue and increased muscle and liver glycogen content, which provide energy during exercise. ([2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31652711/))
- A systematic review and meta-analysis found that long-term supplementation with CoQ10 (most studies were 2-4 months while one was 13 months) at dosages varying from 34-225 mg/day can significantly reduce blood pressue. ([2007](https://www.nature.com/articles/1002138))

#### Vitamin B12

**Vitamin B12** (cobalamin, methylcobalamin) is a cofactor and precursor of neurotransmitters acetylcholine, dopamine, GABA, norepinephrine, and serotonin. 

- Even mild B12 deficiency was [associated](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22788704/) with cognitive decline over 8 years.
- The [BLAtwelve Study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33375429/) tested the effects of [Bacopa monnieri](#bacopa), [Lycopene](#lycopene), [Astaxanthin](#astaxanthin), and Vitamin B12, finding that a mix of the four compounds administered orally once a day to subjects aged 60 years old or more experienced improved cognitive performance after 8 weeks.

#### Vitamin C

**Vitamin C** ( "ascorbic acid") is a water-soluble antioxidant that can interact directly with free radicals. Its efficacy as an antioxidant has been closely associated with that of [Vitamin E](#vitmain-e), which it may regenerate by reducing the Vitamin E radical.

- A [2018 study](http://www.bslonline.org/journal/view.html?doi=10.15616/BSL.2018.24.4.311) suggested that Vitamin C could inhibit [visceral adipocyte](#vat) hypertrophy
- A [long-term study published in 2008](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1028653) found that there was no significant effect of vitamin C on cardiovascular health.
- The body tightly controls serum concentration of vitamin C. Dosages of 200-300 mg/day result in concentrations of 70 micromol/L, whereas dosages of 1.25 g/day produce concentrations of only 135 micromol/L.
