# SSH

SSH is a secure protocol and the most common way of remotely administering Linux servers and other equipment.
SSH uses **symmetrical encryption**, which means a single key encrypts outbound messages to and inbound messages from the other participant.

The SSH session is established in two stages:

1. Negotiate session key
2. Authenticate the user

The symmetrical key used for the session, called the **session key**, is negotiated through the asymmetrical [Diffie-Hellman](#diffie-hellman) key exchange protocol.
This algorithm combines private data with public data from the other participant to produce the identical, session key, and the encryption used for the rest of the connection is called **binary packet protocol**.

The simplest and least secure method of authentication is password-based.
Although the password is sent through the encryption, it is still considered vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

SSH **key pairs**, which are asymmetric, are recommended. These are what is generated by [**ssh-keygen**](#ssh-keygen), and stored in **$HOME/.ssh** with names that reflect the encryption algorithm, i.e. "id_rsa" and "id_rsa.pub", etc.
The public key, used to **encrypt** data for the private key, can be freely shared.
In fact, this is the purpose of **ssh-copy-id**, to share the public key.
However the private key, which is used for decryption, must be kept secret.

The client sends an ID for the key pair it wants to authenticate with to the server. The server then checks the **authorized_keys** file of the requested account for the ID.
A random number is generated by the server, encrypted with the public key, and sent to the client.
The client then decrypts the random number and combines it with the shared session key and calculates the MD5 hash.
This hash is then sent back to the server, which checks the calculation.


Note that the SSH server is named **openssh-server** in Ubuntu repos and the service is named **ssh**, as opposed to **sshd** on Red Hat systems.

#### X forwarding

### Configuration

Server and client configuration both use the same set of [keywords](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config) that can be defined inline on invocation or in config files.

### Client configuration
:   
    ```yaml
    Host home
        HostName 192.168.1.1
        User root
        Port 50022
        SetEnv BAT_THEME=OneHalfLight # (1)
        LocalForward 8080 localhost:8080 # (2)
    ```

    1. [**SetEnv**](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config#SetEnv) allows environment variables to be set in a remote session. 
    However, these same environment variables must be explicitly specified in [**AcceptEnv**](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config#AcceptEnv) key of the [server configuration](#server-configuration).
    This entry will set a specific syntax highlighting theme for use on the bat CLI utility.
    ```
    AcceptEnv BAT_THEME
    ```
    2. The use of [**LocalForward**](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config#LocalForward) here is equivalent to the use of the **-L** option at the command-line:
    ```sh
    ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 $SERVER
    ```

#### SSH to a transient server
:   
    To prevent recording a transient server to the client's known hosts file, for example when SSHing to many hosts from a single client, say while managing a corporate environment.
    ```
    UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null # (1)
    StrictHostKeyChecking no # (2)
    ```

    1. [**UserKnownHostsFile**](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config#UserKnownHostsFile)
    2. [**StrictHostKeyChecking**](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config#StrictHostKeyChecking)



#### Canonical hostname
:   
    In [corporate environments with verbose domain names](https://serverfault.com/questions/363055/regular-expression-matching-in-ssh-config), [**canonical hostnames**](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config#CanonicalDomains) can be configured to automatically append repetitive domain names ("canonicalize") to destination hosts.

    In this example, any connection made to a hostname beginning with "server" will append "example.com".
    ```
    Host server*
        CanonicalDomains example.com # (1)
        CanonicalizeHostname always # (2)
    ```

    1. [**CanonicalDomains**](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config#CanonicalDomains)
    2. [**CanonicalizeHostname**](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config#CanonicalizeHostname)
