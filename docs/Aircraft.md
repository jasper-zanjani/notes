#### Mig-35

Export variant of the MiG-29M2 with:

- New MFD displays instead of analog instruments
- RD-33MKB engines that implement thrust-vectoring
- AESA radar
- The ability to be armed with ground-attack weapons like bombs


#### Su-30

The Su-30 was originally called the Su-27PU and intended to be a long-range interceptor.
The airframe of the Su-27PU, in turn, was based on that of the Su-27UB, another variant intended to be a two-seat trainer.

It entered service in the 1990s as an all-weather multirole two-seat fighter.

It achieved success in the export market:

- **Su-30MKI**, jointly produced with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, featured thrust vectoring.
- **Su-30MKM**, designed for the Royal Malaysian Air Force, inherited the Su-30MKI's thrust vetoring and added avionics upgrades.
- **Su-30MKK**, intended for China, spawned derivatives of its own that were purchased by Vietnam and Venezuela.

#### Su-30SM

Like the Su-35, a modernized variant of the Su-27 that adds jamming pods and improved communications for the Russian Air Force.

The **Su-30SM2** will use the same engine as the [Su-35](#su-35): the AL-41F-1S.

#### Su-33

The Su-33 is a carrier-based variant of the Su-27 with reinforced undercarriage, rugged landing gear, canards, larger folding wings, and slightly more powerful engines.

Although the concept dates from the late 1970s, when it was initially called the Su-27K, it was only introduced in 1998.
It was developed to populate the fighter wings of "heavy aviation cruisers", a hybrid between an aircraft carrier and battleship that was developed by the Soviet Union late in the Cold War.
These wings were originally intended to be filled by the Yak-38, which was a disappointment and quickly retired.

Despite the changes made to accomodate carrier-based aviation, it still proved too big and did not have all the payload delivery features necessary.

Efforts to export the Su-33 to China and India fell through, however China did reverse-engineer it to create the J-11B.
India elected to purchase the more advanced MiG-29K.
Russian Naval Aviation has been the Su-33's only operator.
In 2009, the several dozen Su-33s in service began to be replaced by [MiG-29K][#mig-29k]s.

#### Su-34

Fighter-bomber variant of the Su-27, designed by Rolan Martirosov.
