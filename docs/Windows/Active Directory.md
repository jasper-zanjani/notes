#### Fundamentals
###### History
[Active Directory][AD] has its origins in 1990 when Microsoft released Windows NT 3.0, its first Network Operating System (NOS).
Limitations of NT led Microsoft to rearchitect their solution based on LDAP, a directory service that originated in 1993 as a lighter-weight alternative to [X.500][X.500].

Feature         | NT  | [AD][AD]
---             | --- | ---
Database        | [SAM][SAM] | [ESE][ESE]
Trust           | [Simple][simple trust] | [Transitive][transitive trust]
Domain models   | [Multimaster][Multimaster] [Single-domain][Single-domain] [Single-master][Single-master] [Complete trust][Complete-trust] | [Complete trust][Complete-trust]
Name resolution | [WINS](#glossary "obsolete system that resolves NetBIOS names to IP addresses on Windows networks; required by Windows NT") | DNS
Schemas         | Not extensible | Extensible

###### Major components
AD objects, which can be **containers** or **non-containers** (leaf nodes), are stored in a [DIT][DIT] file. 
Each object is identified by a [GUID][GUID] but also commonly referred to by [distinguished name][DN] (i.e. `dc=mycorp,dc=com`)

Active Directory's structure is based on the concept of a **domain**, based on the following components:
- Hierarchical structure of containers and objects based on [X.500][X.500]
- DNS domain name
- Security service to provide AAA
- Policies to restrict functionality for users or machines

Domains can be organized into [domain trees][domain tree], and domain trees can be organized into [forests][forest].

The most common container type is the [OU][OU].
[Global Catalog][GC] can be used to search for AD objects.

Because Kerberos, which underlies AD, is sensitive to time differences all computers on a domain must have clocks synchronized to within 5 minutes.
[NTP][NTP] can be useful for this.

#### Naming contexts
Predefined [NCs][NC] within AD:
- [Domain Naming Context][Domain Naming Context] 
- [Schema Naming Context][Schema Naming Context] 
- [Configuration Naming Context][Configuration Naming Context] 

#### Schema
Each object in AD is an instance of a class defined in the [schema][schema].
The schema version can be queried from the command-line with [`adfind`][adfind]
[OID][OID]

###### SID
A Windows SID is generally composed of 2 fixed fields and up to 15 additional fields, all separated by dashes:

<code> S-v-[id][identifier authority]-[s1][sub-authority]-[s2][sub-authority]-[s3][sub-authority]-[s4][sub-authority]-[s5][sub-authority]-[s6][sub-authority]-[s7][sub-authority]-[s8][sub-authority]-[s9][sub-authority]-[s10][sub-authority]-[s11][sub-authority]-[s12][sub-authority]-[s13][sub-authority]-[s14][sub-authority]-[s15][sub-authority] </code>

#### AD LDS
[AD LDS][AD LDS] offers a pared-down version of AD that is easy to set up and tear down. It was first released in November 2003 as Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM) V1.0 and offers security benefits because it doesn't enable so many services by default. It was renamed AD LDS with the release of Windows Server 2008.

Differences between AD and AD LDS
- AD LDS is a standalone application run from a `dsamain.exe` process (rather than `lsass.exe`), which means it can be started or stopped on demand without rebooting and multiple instances can be run.
- AD LDS lacks the [global catalog](#gc "read-only catalog of all objects in a forest which contains a subset of attributes for each object; used to perform forest-wide searches") functionality (removing [NSPI](# "\"Name Service Provider Interface\", feature supported by Active Directory's global catalog") and [AB](# "\"Address Book\", feature supported by Active Directory's global catalog") as well)

#### Site topology
A [site topology][site topology] is a map of the [sites][site], [subnets][subnet], [site links][site link], site link bridges, and [connection objects][connection object] as it relates to a forest.

#### WMI
An industry effort to develop a model for managing systems and devices for vendor use arose in the 1990s which resulted in [CIM][CIM], which provides the basis for [WMI][WMI].
The WMI architecture is composed of two main layers: the CIM infrastructure ([CIMOM][CIMOM] and [CIM Repository][CIM Repository]) and the [WMI providers][WMI provider]
Each provider is associated with a namespace, which is similar in concept to a filesystem.

#### .NET
The [.NET Framework][.NET Framework] was developed with the intention of replacing the old Win32 and COM APIs. It has two major components:
- Common Language Runtime (CLR)
- .NET Framework class library
#### Searching Active Directory
