#### Kia Optima

The previous generation Kia Optima offers an impressive 2.0L turbo four-cylinder paired with a dual-clutch transmission.

#### Kia Seltos

A new subcompact SUV offering introduced in 2021, designed to imitate the Land-Roveresque cues of the hot-selling Telluride.
It comes with a Bose sound system for higher trims, although there is very poor noise insulation.

LX, S, and EX trims use the same 2.0L i4 found in the Forte, paired with a CVT, starting around $24,900.

S and SX trims have a torquey 1.6L turbo i4 paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission and AWD standard.

No ventilated seats.


#### Kia Soul

The Kia Soul is the last survivor of the box car segment and has even been Kia's most successful model.
In 2017 the top of the-line Exclaim model was introduced with a [1.6L turbo four-cylinder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrNEHeBUKDI).

The Soul was introduced in 2010 and each model year introduced iterative changes.

After 2020, the Base, Plus (+) and Exclaim (!) trims were renamed LX, S, and EX, although the 1.6L turbocharger that was previously available to the Exclaim was exclusively relegated to the new Turbo trim.
In the 2020 year only, this Turbo trim was confusingly called the GT-Line Turbo.
The non-turbo GT-Line trim, despite its name, did not feature an engine or performance different from that of the other trims.

In 2023 the turbo option was dropped entirely.

The Kia Soul LX is available new from $22,000.

The [fifth-generation](https://www.motortrend.com/news/2023-kia-sportage-first-look-review/) refresh is built on the [N3 platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycVPGHfknTw).
It offers a hybrid 1.6L turbo 4-cylinder with 38 mpg city and highway.
Unlike the [Tucson](#hyundai-tucson), Kia offers FWD.

EX trims and up have a 12.3 inch display, whereas lower trims have only an 8 inch.

The Tucson had a [refresh](https://www.cars.com/research/hyundai-tucson/) for the 2022 model that introduced a lot of new technology and made the Tucson one of the roomiest options in the segment.

The [Tucson Hybrid](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/hyundai/tucson-hybrid/), which uses a 1.6L turbo GDI I-4, is not much more expensive than the gas, but offers much more torque and 30% better fuel economy in a stepped automatic transmission.
This gives it segment-leading acceleration.
Non-hybrid Tucson trims all use the same 2.5L engine, which was described as lethargic.
It is a well-rounded car that feels like it's well put-together.

Used models of the latest generation of the Tucson Hybrid are available in the 30s.
Courtesy Hyundai offers 0% APR for 48 months on the Tucson (excluding the Hybrid).

The **third generation (2005-2021)** was notable for being much smaller than competitors, almost the size of a [hatchback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlp4Gfc0m0U).

A powerful 1.6L turbo four-cyclinder engine (175 hp/195 lb. ft., available to Value and Limited trims) was discontinued in [2019](https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/hyundai/tucson/2019) along with the 7-speed dual-clutch which was paired with it.

This engine was replaced by a 2.4L naturally aspirated four-cylinder (184 hp/ 175 lb. ft.), the same as that available in the Kia Sportage.
Performance with this naturally aspirated engine was noted for being anemic with poor gas mileage.

Android Auto became available in [2017](https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/hyundai/tucson/2017).

Of the various trims, the Value has a panoramic sunroof and parking sensors, which are lacking in the Sport.


### Infiniti

#### Infiniti QX30

The [Infiniti Q30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiniti_Q30) was sold between 2016 and 2019 as a premium hatchback.
The [QX30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiniti_QX30), with higher ground clearance, is described as a subcompact luxury crossover that was designed to [straddle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EB5b1wQCRw) the border between hatchback, wagon, and crossover segments.
The QX30 targets [premium city-dwelling customers or first-time luxury buyers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2dbiBlUXjc) who couldn't otherwise afford the Q50, which had been Infiniti's previous entry-level model.

The QX30 is based on the third-generation Mercedes-Benz A-class chassis, and so uses many Mercedes-Benz parts. It is built in the QX30 factory in Tennessee.

The [sportiest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJY3nFKM3Qw) and [best trim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcOw6As0hSU) of the compact crossover segment (competing with the Honda CR-V and the Toyota RAV-4).

These models predominantly used a 2.5L turbo I-4 engine  (as of the 2019 year and later) which always came paired with AWD. 
Naturally aspirated engines are much more common and, in used cars, much less expensive.
But the 6-speed transmission is a weakness that shortchanges the engine, especially in comparison with competitors with have moved to a CVT in the case of Honda or an 8-speed tranmission in the case of Toyota.

The 2019 refresh introduced Android Auto and Apple CarPlay as a standard feature, although older models can be retrofitted at additional cost.

The 2021 refresh introduced a 10 inch screen and upgraded backup camera which are highly recommended over the 2020 model.

The [2022 refresh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg_E1bTdSL8) introduced a new, larger key fob as well as reshuffled trim tiers: the new Signature trim is fully-loaded.

New CX-5s start from $28,000 and up.
Turbo-equipped CX-5s run from $35,000 and up.

#### Mazda CX-30

The CX-30 is a subcompact crossover launched in 2020, competing with the smaller vehicles like the Honda HR-V and Toyota CH-R.

Like the [Mazda3](#mazda3) on which it is based, it incorporates many [improvements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4643tIZhcI) to the interior and user experience.
It uses the same naturally aspirated 2.5L I-4 found in the [Mazda3](#mazda3) and [CX-5](#mazda-cx-5), although turbocharged trims appear to be available at considerable markup.

The Preferred Trim has a Bose sound system.
And as with other vehicles, Mazda prefers the driver not to have the added distraction of a touchscreen and insists that the infotainment system be controlled using the control knob.

New CX-30s run in the mid- to high 20s.

#### [Mazda3](https://www.cars.com/research/mazda-mazda3/)

Too small

The latest and current generation was introduced in 2019.
Three main trim levels are Select, Preferred, and Premium, with all trims available in FWD and AWD.

Mazda put a lot of effort into [redesigning and improving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taQDqwecojc) the interior, from physical controls to the center console to the improved 8.8 inch screen and command knob.
Changes to the driving experience are a marked improvement from the previous generation.

The naturally aspirated engine (2.5L i4, 186 hp and 186 lb-ft.) has [anemic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv0rLLENF4E) performance, but the turbocharged version (2.5L turbo i4, 227 hp, 310 lb-ft) are class-leading, aside from performance-focused specialty models like the Civi Type R.

The driving experience is unremarkable and inoffensive.
The 2.5L 4-cylinder dates from 2002 and [feels sluggish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxC4mzmttwY) paired with a CVT.
