# Query Languages
## SQL syntax
| Syntax | Effect |
| :----- | :----- |
CREATE DATABASE db;
USE db;
CREATE TABLE tbl;

#### `INNER JOIN`
Using `INNER JOIN` in a query allows you to combine row data across two separate tables using the **primary key**, the unique identifier for the underlying entity.
```sql
SELECT * FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 on table1.id = table2.id
```
#### `OUTER JOIN`
The commands `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL JOIN` allow you to join tables with asymmetric data. `LEFT JOIN` includes rows from A regardless if whether a matching row is found in B. `RIGHT JOIN` includes rows from B regardless if a matching row is found in A. `FULL JOIN` means rows from both tables are kept, regardless of whether a matching row exists in either table.
#### `INSERT INTO` ... `VALUES`
The **database schema** describes the structure of each table and the datatypes that each column of the table can contain. `INSERT INTO` is used to add data to a table, in conjunction with `VALUES`.
```sql
INSERT INTO mytable (col1, col2, col3, ...) VALUES (val1, val2, val3, ...);
```
#### `UPDATE` ... `SET`
Change the value of a record
```sql
UPDATE mytable SET col1 = val1, col2 = val2, col3 = val3 WHERE condition;
```
#### `DELETE FROM` ... `WHERE`
Delete rows matching a condition
```sql
DELETE FROM mytable WHERE condition;
```
#### `CREATE TABLE`
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mytable (col1 DataType TableConstraint DEFAULT val1, col2 DataType TableConstraint DEFAULT val2 ...);
```
- `DataType` can be one of the following types: `INTEGER`, `BOOLEAN`, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`, `REAL`, `CHARACTER(n)` where n is the maximum number of characters, `VARCHAR(n)`, `TEXT`, `DATE`, `DATETIME`, `BLOB`.
- `TableConstraint` can be one of the following values: `PRIMARY KEY`, `AUTOINCREMENT`, `UNIQUE`, `NOT NULL`, `CHECK (expression)`, `FOREIGN KEY`
```sql
CREATE TABLE movies (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT,
  director TEXT,
  year INTEGER,
  length_minutes INTEGER
);
```
#### `ALTER TABLE`
```sql
ALTER TABLE mytable ADD col1 DataType TableConstraint DEFAULT val1;
```
#### `DROP TABLE`

#### Expressions
Mathematical and string functions and operators can transform values when query is executed, with the resulting variable name being declared with the `AS` keyword. It can also be used to create aliases for unwieldy column and table names.
```sql
SELECT col_expression AS expr_description FROM mytable;
```
Boolean expressions can be used to filter search results with `WHERE`
### Aggregate functions
**Aggregate expressions** or functions allow you to summarize information about a group of rows of data, such as `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG`, and `SUM`. Aggregates can be rendered in groups using `GROUP BY`
In order to filter rows while using `GROUP BY`, instead of `WHERE` use the `HAVING` clause, which is used exclusively with `GROUP BY` for this express purpose and written the same way.
### Order of execution
1. `FROM`, `JOIN`
2. `WHERE`
3. `GROUP BY`
4. `HAVING`
5. `SELECT`
6. `DISTINCT`
7. `ORDER BY`
8. `LIMIT`, `OFFSET`

## Security
#### Reduce attack surface
- Isolate the DB server from other applications and services
- Remove unnecessary features from the DB server installation
- Block access from any other server except the application server, or at least allow SQL traffic to and from only designated IP addresses and place the SQL server in a VLAN.
#### Procedures
- Regularly update and patch the server
- Backups should be secured: restrict access to backup directories, storage hosting data, physical security of removable media, network access to backups...
- Sanitize SQL queries from a web application to prevent SQL injection
#### Human factor
- Set a strong admin password
- Use Least Privilege when assigning permissions. Grant read access to **views** instead of tables directly.
- Implement constant visibility into the DB server's configuration, with alerts when configuration changes or violates policy.
