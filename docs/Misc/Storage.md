## NAS
*[PERC]: PowerEdge RAID Controller

- The Dell PowerEdge R720 and R720XD use the H710 PERC RAID controller with 512 MB cache
- [**Helios64**](https://kobol.io/) is billed as the ultimate ARM-powered NAS.
It comes with its own UPS which can power the unit for 15 minutes.
It was [reviewed](https://selfhosted.show/33) by Alex from the Self-Hosted podcast, who took issue with poor build quality and value.
Consumer-friendly products from Synology and QNap may perhaps be a better solution.
- [Synology 1621+](https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/DS1621+) was reviewed in [Self-Hosted 43](https://selfhosted.show/43).
Synology offers DSM for easy management.
- Brian Moses has an [annual blog series](https://blog.briancmoses.com/categories/nas-build/) on making your own DIY NAS.

## Flash memory

*[SLC]: Single-Level Cell
*[MLC]: Multi-Level Cell
*[TLC]: Triple-Level Cell
*[QLC]: Quad-Level Cell
*[P/E]: program/erase

3D NAND flash chips can be defined by how much data is stored in memory cells which are stacked vertically. SLC, MLC, TLC, and QLC represent progressively more memory-dense NAND technologies. They also represent progressively **less** long-lived devices in terms of P/E cycles.
