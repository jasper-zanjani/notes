## Emoji

The codepoint [U+FE0F](https://graphemica.com/FE0F) ("variation select 16") is placed immediately after an emoji to indicate it should indeed be rendered as an emoji.
This is used for some ambiguous codepoints that can be rendered [either](http://xahlee.info/comp/text_vs_emoji.html) as emoji or as older-style glyphs, such as the heart, arrows, etc.
