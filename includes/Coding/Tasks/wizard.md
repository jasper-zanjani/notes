A wizard presents a series of steps or conditions that the user needs to complete in order to accomplish a goal, and as a design pattern is familiar from Windows installation wizards.
It comprises a series of screens or dialogue boxes that walk users from start to completion, taking interactive input.

1. Introduction
2. License: at least a radio or check button which forces the user to accept license terms before proceeding. Some wizards disable these buttons unless the user scrolls to the bottom.
3. Installation options or location. Some wizards present these in several pages in sequence. Others present a single tree with expandable nodes.
4. Confirmation with a summary of installation options selected.
5. Progress bar
6. Finish: optionally radio buttons allowing an immediate restart, if necessary. Some installers display checkboxes that allow the user to immediately launch the application or documentation or even donation pages.
