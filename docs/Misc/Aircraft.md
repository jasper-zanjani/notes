# Aircraft

Airbus formed in 1969 as a multinational conglomerate with the purpose of offering a European response to Boeing's domination of civil aviation with the development of the **A300**.

#### Airbus A300
:   
    A300 offered a cost-effective alternative with only two engines at a time when the market was dominated by American aircraft with three or four engines.
    Despite initial market resistance, Airbus eventually succeeded in an order from Eastern Airlines after lending 4 A300 aircraft to the airline for 6 months to evaluate it.

#### Boeing 787
:   
    The Boeing 787 originated from the ashes of the [Boeing Sonic Cruiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Sonic_Cruiser), which was ended in 2002 at a time of rising fuel costs and lowered travel demand.
    The 787 is referred to as a *long-hauler* due to its efficiency, which allowed it to be used to offer affordable direct flights.
    This coincided with a shift in the industry from the hub-and-spoke model to the **point to point** model.
    
    The 787 was the first commercial airliner to be made of mostly composite materials.
    Large sections of the 787's fuselage are created from carbon fiber using massive molds and automated tape-laying machines.
    This created great weight savings by avoiding the need for thousands of rivets, which also would have increased drag on the surface of the fuselage, if they had been created from aluminum sheets.

    The 787 uses supercritical wings, which allows more useful internal volume and also allow greater efficiency by avoiding airflow separation and reducing vortices.
    Carbon fiber is also more flexible than aluminum, and its use in the wingbox allows the wings to be made with a higher aspect ratio, further improving efficiency.
    Because of the extensive use of carbon fiber, titanium is also used more than in other airliners to avoid the galvanic corrosion that would be caused by having carbon fiber in contact with aluminum.
    Some parts that were made in titanium were eventually changed to composites or aluminum to cut costs.

    Some parts were also made from 3D-printed titanium to reduce the amount of titanium used and to increase the speed of production.
    This development resulted in the first 3D-printed structural components to be certified by the FAA.

    The 787 also incorporates a Hybric Laminar Flow Control, a mysterious system that draws in boundary-layer air through small holes in the skin of the aircraft to enhance laminar flow and reduce turbulent flow.
    This system is incorporated only in the horizontal and vertical tails.

    The 787's engine is the GEnX, which incorporated many innovations to increase efficiency while reducing nitrous oxide emissions.
    The fan blades in this engine are made from carbon fiber rather than titanium, allowing them to be lighter (by 15%) and thinner.
    A more sophisticated fan shape was also made possible with this material, which reduced the number of fan blades to 18 from 22.
    
    In order to reduce fan speed, a planetary gear was considered but discounted for the increase in weight and complexity.
    A planetary gear was used in the PW1000G engine used in the A320neo to achieve the highest bypass ratio in a commercial airline engine.
    However the solution had teething problems.
    The GEnX incorporates three "blisk" (bladed disk) stages, where the blades and disk are manufactured from a single piece of metal.
    The alloy used, gamma titanium-aluminum, is also a novel material in civil aviation and an improvement over nickel.
    This allows an increase in compression ratio despite a reduction in the number of total stages (to 10 from 14 in the CF6 engine which the GEnX replaces).

    The 787's main competition is the Airbus A350-XLR.

#### Boeing 777
:   
    The third-generation of Boeing 777 variants, the 777-8 and 777-9, was launched in 2013 and is referred to as the 777X collectively.
    The 777X incorporates the GE9X.
    
    Boeing 777-800 has not sold a new passenger unit since 2013. 
    It was developed under the influence of Middle Eastern airlines who lobbied for a larger wing, which ended up making the aircraft more inefficient, especially the 777-800. 
    The 777-8 is almost 40 thousand pounds heavier than its rival Airbus A350-1000 which was built using Aluminum-Lithium (Al-Li) in the fuselage. 
    Boeing declined to use Al-Li in the 777-8's development.
