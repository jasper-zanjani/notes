Can't figure out how to integrate Font Awesome icons!

i <3 :fa-coffee: and I <3 :fa-beer: and I'll buy wayland ten of both. 

We can use Material Icons :material-airplane:.

We can also use Fontawesome Icons :fontawesome-solid-ambulance:.

That's not all, we can also use Octicons :octicons-octoface:.
