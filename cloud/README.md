## NoSQL
NoSQL databases differ from **relational databases** in that they do not obey the principle of data **normalization**.
That is, the same data can be stored in more than one place.
This is an advantage for databases that are optimized for reads as opposed to writes, because fewer queries are needed to retrieve information.
However, when changing information that is duplicated in several places, write operations will be more laborious and prone to error.
NoSQL databases are also **horizontally scalable** because the information can be sharded horizontally more easily than relational database, which are only **vertically scalable** (meaning scaling them requires larger and larger computers) and can only be sharded vertically. <sup>[YouTube](https://youtu.be/v_hR4K4auoQ?t=620 "YouTube - What is a NoSQL Database? How is Cloud Firestore structured? | Get to Know Cloud Firestore #1")</sup>

- [Cosmos DB][CosmosDB]

#### Cosmos DB
Fully managed JSON document database service with turnkey global distribution and transparent multi-master replication.
Pricing for Cosmos DB relies on **Request Units**, which incorporate both the number of returned records as well as a fractional amount that reflects the complexity of the query.

### AWS NoSQL
- DynamoDB
- SimpleDB
#### DynamoDB
Wide-column NoSQL database with the choice between **strongly consistent** and **eventually consistent** (half the cost) reads. DynamoDB offers two types of indexes: 
- **Global Secondary Index** allows you to create a completely new aggregation of data
- **Local Secondary Index (LSI)** alternate sort key attribute that allows only sorting

GSI updates are **eventually consistent**, with asynchronous updates populated after an update response is passed to the client.
<sup>[YouTube](https://youtu.be/HaEPXoXVf2k "AWS re:Invent 2018: Amazon DynamoDB Deep Dive: Advanced Design Patterns for DynamoDB (DAT401)")</sup>

DynamoDB Streams (changelog for the DynamoDB table) interfaces with AWS Lambda to implement **complex queries**, computed values like sum, average, maximum, etc. 
These are implemented in a different **processing space** than the DynamoDB table itself, so that it does not affect the table.

AWS Lambda has an **invocation role** which defines what Lambda can **see** (triggered upon a change to the table as reported in DynamoDB Streams) and an **execution role** which defines what it can **do**.

#### Firebase
Resources
- [Introducing Firebase Realtime database](https://youtu.be/U5aeM5dvUpA "YouTube - Introducing Firebase Realtime Database")
- [Firebase web application tutorial](https://youtu.be/9kRgVxULbag "YouTube - Firebase - Ultimate Beginner's guide")

Firebase is a completely unstructured NoSQL database that is known for its client libraries.
Firestore has almost completely supplanted Firebase for most applications. <sup>[YouTube](https://youtu.be/TmXct7seeBY)</sup>

**Firebase Auth** offers a free user interface for applications, **Firebase UI**.

#### Firestore
Cloud Firestore was released from beta in early 2019 and combines and improves upon functionality of previous products named **Cloud Datastore** and **Firebase Realtime Database**. <sup>[YouTube](https://youtu.be/U5aeM5dvUpA "Introducing Firebase Realtime Database") [The Firebase Blog](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2017/10/cloud-firestore-for-rtdb-developers.html "Cloud Firestore vs the Realtime Database: Which one do I use?") </sup>

Cloud Firestore is organized into **documents**, which consist of key-value pairs and are similar to JSON objects, and **collections**. JSON-like objects are called **maps** and keys are called **fields** in Firestore. Collections can contain only documents, but documents sub-collections. Root can only contain collections. So navigating deeper and deeper into the information store will involve alternating between collections and documents. <sup>[YouTube](https://youtu.be/v_hR4K4auoQ?t=620 "YouTube - What is a NoSQL Database? How is Cloud Firestore structured? | Get to Know Cloud Firestore #1")</sup>

Firestore features a compatibility mode that emulates the behavior of Datastore in accessing Firestore's storage layer while removing some of Datastore's limitations.

Queries in Firestore can only be used to find documents stored in one specific collection or sub-collection.
However a **collection group query**, meaning one that spans multiple collections, began to be supported in 2019.
Complex relational queries are not possible (in a single query), and query results are usually returned based on equality or greater-than/less-than comparisons.
The field has to be specified as having a scope of "Collection group" within GCP, and there is a limit of (about) 200 for these queries. 
<sup>[Firebase blog](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2017/10/cloud-firestore-for-rtdb-developers.html "Cloud Firestore vs the Realtime Database: Which one do I use?") [YouTube](https://youtu.be/U5aeM5dvUpA "YouTube - Introducing Firebase Realtime Database") [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Ofux_4c94FI "YouTube - How do queries work in Cloud Firestore? | Get to Know Cloud Firestore #2")</sup>

An index is created for every field in every document added to a collection, which results in very fast query times that are proportional to the number of **results**, not records searched. 
This structure ensures that equality searches are highly performant, as are comparison searches using greater-than or less-than.
But this implementation creates bizarre limitations to Firestore's querying capabilities:
There is no native way to perform wildcard searches or `OR` queries. 
For common instances of such queries, Google recommends adding a field that contains the value for each record 

Inequality searches present a challenge for Firestore.
For some queries that combine conditions on more than one field (i.e. restaurants within a certain range of a location), Firebase will create a "composite index" (only within the index, the document itself is not affected) automatically to facilitate searches on those fields.

Unlike **Firebase**, which charges based on the volume of data stored, **Firestore** charges based on number of operations performed and records returned.
<sup>[YouTube](https://youtu.be/6NegFl9p_sE "YouTube - Cloud Firestore Pricing | Get to Know Cloud Firestore #3")</sup>


#### BigTable
GCP Realtime database used for Big Data <sup>[db-engines.com](https://db-engines.com/en/system/Google+Cloud+Bigtable%3BGoogle+Cloud+Firestore "System Properties Comparison Google Cloud Bigtable vs. Google Cloud Firestore")</sup>

BigTable evolved out of Google's need to ensure access to petabytes of data in its web search business line.
It was described in a 2006 research paper that ended up launching the entire NoSQL industry.
In 2015 it was made available as a service to cloud customers. <sup>[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qieV-WCU_w "YouTube - Introduction to Google BigTable: Best Uses, Design, and Demo")</sup>

BigTable doesn't support secondary indexes. <sup> [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxC_iTLGtLA "YouTube - The Right Bigtable Index Makes All the Difference") [Medium](https://medium.com/@duhroach/the-right-cloud-bigtable-index-makes-all-the-difference-3bcabe9bd65a "The right Cloud Bigtable index makes all the difference")</sup>

Two types:
- **Managed** instance groups operate applications like web front-ends across a group of identical VMs created with a template.
They provide high availability, healing, scaling, and automatic updates.
- **Unmanaged** instance groups allow you to manually load balance a group of VMs.
VMs can be added or removed at will.

Cloud Run is built on a native open standard that will allow using the same container on other cloud providers.
It bills down to the nearest 100 ms interval.
Cloud Run provides an HTTPS endpoint to the container.
```sh
gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/my-project/helloworld
```
Cloud Run can also run on your own K8S cluster running on [GKE][GKE], recommended for workloads that have a consistently high level of traffic, since you are billed for the provisioned cluster resources.
However, resources like CPU, GPU, and other items can be customized.
```sh
gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/my-project/helloworld --cluster my-gke-cluster
```
