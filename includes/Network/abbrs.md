*[UNC]: universal naming convention: industry-standard naming scheme for computers and resources that works in most environments, including Windows and Unix (i.e. \\server\share)
*[UPC]: ultra polished connector: connector with an endface polished at 0 degrees
*[UTM]: unified threat management: also "next generation firewall (NGFW)", device that performs at least functions of a firewall as well as IDS/IPS, and potentially anti-virus, spam filtering, content filtering, and data loss prevention as well; designed to provide broad-based security for a network; appliance that integrates a wide range of security features, combining the functions of firewall, gateway antivirus, IDS, VPN, and endpoint control, and providing better incident awareness, security control, network traffic notification, and monitoring of user behavior and application content than individual devices
*[UTP]: unshielded twisted pair: does not provide protection from EMI
*[VDSL]: Variable Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL): asymmetric DSL service that uses fiber-optic cabling, fastest available
*[VHDSL/VDSL]: very high bit rate DSL: asymmetric service that offers data rates up to 10 Mbps
*[VLSM]: Variable Length Subnet Masking: using a different subnet mask for the same network number on different subnets
*[VNC]: Virtual Network Computing: graphic remote desktop sharing system that can be used as an in-band management method
*[VRF]: virtual routing and forwarding: allows multiple instances of a routing table to coexist within the same router simultaneously
*[VRRP]: Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol: provides for automatic assignment of available IP routers to participating hosts, which increases the availability and reliability of routing paths via automatic default gateway selections on an IP subnetwork; IETF open standard that operates in a manner similar to Cisco's HSRP
*[VTP]: VLAN Trunk Protocol&#10;&#10;Cisco protocol that facilitates VLAN creation and management across many switches using interswitch links called trunks.
*[WAN]: Wide-Area Network: network that spans more than one geographic location, spanning more than one separated LAN
*[WAP]: Wireless Application Protocol: obsolete protocol for wireless access
*[WINS]: Windows Internet Name Service: obsolete system that resolves NetBIOS names to IP addresses on Windows networks; required by Windows NT
*[WLAN]: Wireless LAN: incorporates wireless infrastructure
*[WLC]: wireless LAN controller: 
*[WMS]: Warehouse Management System: software module used to provide management tools for warehouse operations
*[WPA-PSK]: WPA-Personal Shared Key: passphrase consisting of 8-63 ASCII characters is all that is required to gain access
*[WPA2-PSK]: WPA2-Personal: uses a pre-shared key (PSK) of 64 hexadecimal digits or a passphrase of 8 to 63 ASCII characters
*[WPS]: Wi-Fi protected setup: security standard created by the Wi-Fi Alliance to increase security features of networks
*[WSGI]: Web Server Gateway Interface: simple calling convention for web servers to forward requests to web applications or frameworks
*[WWN]: World Wide Name: unique identifier assigned by IEEE to a manufacturer and hard-coded into a Fibre Channel device
*[XDSL]: Extended Digital Subscriber Line: label for all the variations of DSL available lumped together
*[Zeroconf]: Zero Configuration: set of tools and tricks/techniques that exist within TCP/IP with the goal of allowing devices to connect and configure without manual configuration
*[iSCSI]: internet small computer system interface: allows IP to be used to send SCSI commands
